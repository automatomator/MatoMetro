lol fuc u

but yea, maybe input a scale mask to make life easier for you.
may need a data file too

expectations from next version: 
	Have "real life adjusted scaling" ie remove pseudo scaling.
	introduce new button in UI to compare serrated and unserrated leaf; feature identification maybe?
	Results pages is structured better.
	do a report level study on effect of resolution and blurring, separately...
	Breakdown my package into:
		scale introduction model: also has option of pseudo scaling 
		
		pre processing model: lets me select operations I want to use for preprocessing on input
		boundary detection model: lets me select operations I want to use for boundary detect on input
		analysis model: lets me select things I want to analyse for, eg: compare what things?
		report model: lets me select things to report, may change depending on things to analyse
